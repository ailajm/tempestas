## User Stories:
* As a user I can fetch data from the OpenWeather API using a text string that I input and manipulate a button to submit.

* As a user I would like to be able to fetch more than one day of data, so that I may be better prepared for the coming weather patterns and monitor trends.

* As a user I would like to be able to set my region for language, so that I may better navigate and understand the website.

* As a user I would like to be able to set a default locale, so that I don't have to manually input my location everytime I vist the application.
